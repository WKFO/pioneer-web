Donate to Pioneer

Pioneer is developed by a group of volunteers from all over the world, giving
up their spare time and energy to try and make something great. 

So if you enjoy playing Pioneer and would like to support its continued
development, please consider donating. <a href='https://www.paypal.com/'>PayPal</a>
and <a href='https://flattr.com/'>Flattr</a> are our preferred donation
providers, but if these don't work for you please
<a href='mailto:rob@eatenbyagrue.org?subject=Pioneer%20donation'>let us know</a>
and we can make other arrangements.

The money you donate goes will go towards web hosting (this website,
development forum, wiki and mailing list) and providing the build servers.

If you have donated in the past and would like to be acknowledged here,
<a href='mailto:rob@eatenbyagrue.org?subject=Pioneer%20donation'>let us know</a>.

Thank you all for your continued support of Pioneer.
