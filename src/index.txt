Pioneer is a space adventure game set in our galaxy at the turn of the 31st
century.

The game is open-ended, and you are free to eke out whatever kind of 
space-faring existence you can think of. Look for fame or fortune by exploring 
the millions of star systems. Deliver or trade tons of goods across the galaxy. 
Help various factions fighting for power, freedom or self-determination. Turn 
to a life of crime as a pirate, smuggler or bounty hunter. The universe is 
whatever you make of it.

Pioneer is under constant development and has a friendly community of players,
modders and developers around it. We release a new version almost every day.
We'd love for you to try it and make part of the galaxy your own!
