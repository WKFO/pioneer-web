Pioneer is a space adventure game set in our galaxy at the turn of the 31st
century.

The game is open-ended, and you are free to eke out whatever kind of
space-faring existence you can think of. Look for fame or fortune by exploring
the millions of star systems. Turn to a life of crime as a pirate, smuggler or
bounty hunter. Forge and break alliances with the various factions fighting
for power, freedom or self-determination.  The universe is whatever you make
of it.

Pioneer is under constant development and has a friendly community of players,
modders and developers around it. We release a new version every month. We'd
love for you to try it and make part of the galaxy your own!
